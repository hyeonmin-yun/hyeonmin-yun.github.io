<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in **Artificial Intelligence** and an M.S. student in **Mathematics** based in Seoul, South Korea. My research lies at the intersection of AI and Mathematics, specifically within the domain of **AI for Science**.

My primary research interests include **Sampling**, **Stochastic Optimal Control**, and **Schrödinger Bridges**. I am particularly interested in applying these concepts to the Ising and XY models, as well as generative models for molecular conformers using SDEs. On the mathematical side, I have a strong background in **Complex Analysis (Riemann Surfaces)** and **Algebraic/Differential Geometry**, which I aim to integrate into deep learning frameworks.

I am currently looking for research internship opportunities in the United States (Summer/Fall 2026).
